# CustomExploits
Working exploits I modified from other people’s exploits, I have found many times when using github or searchsploit that the exploits are quite long and have code that doesnt really do much in the actual exploitation proccess in my opinion, but who am i to say anything, i created this repo for explits that i have found and then recreated with just the nessessary code to have the exploit execute properly with some obvious messages to show that the code is doing what it needs to.
